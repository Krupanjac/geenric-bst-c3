# Binary Search Tree Implementation in C3
This repository contains a simple implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) in the C3 programming language. 
A Binary Search Tree is a data structure that maintains elements in a sorted order, allowing for efficient insertion, deletion, and lookup operations.

## Implementation
The BST is implemented iteratively, with the following key operations:
- Insertion of elements
- Searching for elements
- In-order traversal to display elements in sorted order (recursive)
- Deletion of elements
- freeing the tree from memory


## Usage
To use the BST implementation, you can include the `bst.c3` file in your C3 project and create a BST instance.

How to compile and run:
```
c3c compile-run main.c3 bst.c3
```

This will compile and run the `main.c3` file which demonstrates the usage of the BST.
